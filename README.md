# AllegroSnake
Starter C code for a snake-style game using [Allegro](http://liballeg.org/) for my students in COP1220: Intro to C Spring 2016 class at [Palm Beach State College](http://www.palmbeachstate.edu).

## Credits
All of the code/assets are mine except the following:
* Code borrowed from Zed Shaw's excellent _Learn C The Hard Way_:
  * [dbh.h](http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/ex20.html), last access April 19, 2016.
  * [darray.h and darray.c](http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/ex34.html), last access April 19, 2016.

While the allegro_shell.h and allegro_shell.c are mine they borrow code from Mike Geig's indispensible [_2D Game Development Course_](http://fixbyproximity.com/2d-game-development-course/).
